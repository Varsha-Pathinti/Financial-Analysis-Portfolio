# 📊 FP&A Portfolio: Financial Modeling & BI Dashboards (Synthetic Dataset)
This portfolio showcases my financial modeling and business intelligence skills using a synthetic dataset that simulates multi-year financial activity. The project includes dynamic dashboards, reconciled financial statements, and strategic insights — all built in Excel and Power BI.

**🧠 Project Overview**
- **Dataset**: 2,500-entry General Ledger with mapped Chart of Accounts  
  → Manually constructed to simulate realistic journal transactions across multiple years  
  → Includes debit/credit logic, account mapping, and time-based financial activity  
- **Tools Used**: Excel, Power Pivot, Power BI, DAX
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Profitability bridges
  - Capital structure analysis
  - Forecasting and variance commentary
  - Selector-driven KPI reporting

⚠️ Note: This dataset is entirely synthetic and not tied to any specific industry. It loosely resembles a product-based business but is designed to demonstrate technical and analytical capabilities rather than industry-specific modeling.
